[Global]
	# The [Global] section of this file is used to define the main
	# configuration of the server, like the server name and the ports
	# on which the server should be listening.

	# Server name in the IRC network, must contain at least one dot
	# (".") and be unique in the IRC network. Required!
	Name = $SERVERNAME

	# Info text of the server. This will be shown by WHOIS and
	# LINKS requests for example.
	Info = $INFO

	# Global password for all users needed to connect to the server
	;Password = $PASSWORD

	# Information about the server and the administrator, used by the
	# ADMIN command. Not required by server but by RFC!
	AdminInfo1 = teamchat admin
	AdminInfo2 = Sussex
	AdminEMail = support@teamchat.net

        UsePAM = no

	# Ports on which the server should listen. There may be more than
	# one port, separated with ",". (Default: 6667)
	Ports = $PORT

	# IP address on which the server should listen. (Default: empty,
	# so the server listens on all IP addresses of the system)
	;Listen = 1.2.3.4
        Listen = 127.0.0.1

	# Text file with the "message of the day" (MOTD). This message will
	# be shown to all users connecting to the server:
	MotdFile = $MOTDFILE

	# A simple Phrase (<256 chars) if you don't want to use a motd file.
	# If it is set no MotdFile will be read at all.
	;MotdPhrase = "This is a teamchat IRC server! Start the conversation!"

	# Do NOT change this on Debian! It runs with the default user 'irc'
	;ServerUID = 65534
	;ServerGID = 65534

	PidFile = $PIDFILE

	# After <PingTimeout> seconds of inactivity the server will send a
	# PING to the peer to test whether it is alive or not.
	PingTimeout = 120

	# If a client fails to answer a PING with a PONG within <PongTimeout>
	# seconds, it will be disconnected by the server.

[Operator]

	# more than one [Operator] block, one for each local operator.

	# ID of the operator (may be different of the nick name)
	;Name = TheOper

	# Password of the IRC operator
	;Password = ThePwd

[Server]
	# Other servers are configured in [Server] sections. If you
	# configure a port for the connection, then this ngircd tries to
	# connect to to the other server on the given port; if not it waits
	# for the other server to connect.
	# There may be more than one server block.
	#
	# Server Groups:
	# The ngIRCd allows "server groups": You can assign an "ID" to every
	# server with which you want this ngIRCd to link. If a server of a
	# group won't answer, the ngIRCd tries to connect to the next server
	# in the given group. But the ngircd never tries to connect to two
	# servers with the same group ID.

	# IRC name of the server
	;Name = irc2.debian.org

	# Internet host name of the peer
	;Host = connect-to-host.the.net

	# Port of the server to which the ngIRCd should connect. If you
	# assign no port the ngIRCd waits for incoming connections.
	;Port = 6666

	# Own password for the connection. This password has to be configured
	# as "PeerPassword" on the other server.
	;MyPassword = MySecret

	# Foreign password for this connection. This password has to be
	# configured as "MyPassword" on the other server.
	;PeerPassword = PeerSecret

	# Group of this server (optional)
	;Group = 123

[Channel]
	# Pre-defined channels can be configured in [Channel] sections.
	# Such channels are created by the server when starting up and even
	# persist when there are no more members left.
	# Persistent channels are marked with the mode 'P', which can be set
	# and unset by IRC operators like other modes on the fly.
	# There may be more than one [Channel] block.

	# Name of the channel
	;Name = #ngircd

	# Topic for this channel
	;Topic = Our ngircd testing channel

	# Initial channel modes
	;Modes = tn
